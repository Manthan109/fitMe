## Problem Statement

With increasing cases of COVID 19, the world has come to a halt. Public places have been shut to avoid large gatherings. One such place is Gym, which has made it difficult for so many people to keep up with their fitness. Due to the unfortunate position of isolation, people are struggling with various health-related problems such as obesity, irregular sleep patterns, eye strain, mental stress, decreased immunity, and hence, are at a higher risk of getting infected with the Coronavirus. The impact of staying fit is huge and it helps to be sane with all the stress people have. Now as the gyms are closed and people don't have the required guidance, an alternative is needed. In this pursuit of adapting to modern norms, a solution with gamified concepts is needed to help people with their fitness routine and keep them motivated to exercise daily.
